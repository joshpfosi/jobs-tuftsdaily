# Tufts Daily Job Manager #

A simple web application for managing job requests for photos for the Tufts University Daily newspaper. Editors can request jobs by visiting the home page, while photo administrators can sign in, managing and assigning the jobs to his/her staff. They can all reject, complete, investigate, and edit jobs, as well as add and maintain staff information. Assigning and rejection of jobs sends templated emails to ease the workload of the administrator.
