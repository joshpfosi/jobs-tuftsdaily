Neither of these picture ideas are particularly outstanding so think critically about making strong pictures from a weak lead. Description:\n\nTufts’ Counseling and Mental Health Services (CMHS) has a relatively new system called the Interactive Screening Program (ISP) which allows students to submit anonymous answers to a screening questionnaire. Counselors review the responses they get, and if they see a response from a student who they think they need to reach out to, they can send a message to the student (still anonymously). The program was piloted in 2012, but they’re slowly reaching out to more and more students as they think they can handle more submissions. Talk to Marilyn Downs (Marilyn.Downs@tufts.edu), who is the head of this project. Ask her for the complete history of it, why they decided to do this (what need does it fulfill?), how they’re improving the system, what they plan for the future. Also talk to John Rosario-Perez (John.Rosario_Perez@tufts.edu), who answers the students. How does he maintain their confidentiality? What kind of advice does he give them? For both of them - is this system better than what we had before, or about the same? For a third source, it might be good to find a student (or a few) who is/are willing to share their opinion about it (either someone who has used CMHS before, or someone who hasn’t).
